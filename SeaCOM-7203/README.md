# SeaCOM-7203
The 7203e PCI Express serial interface provides two optically isolated serial ports, each individually configurable for RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485. Each serial port utilizes a 16C952 UART with 128-byte Tx/Rx FIFOs that enables data rates to 460.8K bps for reliable high-speed communications in data-intensive applications. This high-performance UART includes 9-bit framing support and is register compatible with legacy 16550 software applications. 
In addition, the board derives a 62.5 MHz clock from the PCI Express link. 
This ultra-high-speed clock is divided by a flexible 8-bit clock prescalar with 1/8 steps to provide support for the widest range of standard and non-standard baud rates.
